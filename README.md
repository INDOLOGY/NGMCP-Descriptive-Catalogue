# Explanation
The Nepal-German manuscript preservation and cataloguing projects ran from 1970-2014.  The project surveyed the manuscript heritage of Nepal, microfilmed over a hundred thousand manuscripts, and provided descriptive information on these items. 

For fuller descriptions, see:

*  The "NGMPP":  [The Nepal-German Manuscript **Preservation** Project](https://www.aai.uni-hamburg.de/en/forschung/ngmcp/history/about-ngmpp.html) (1970-2002). [Historical sketch by Ehrhard (1991)](http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ebhr/pdf/EBHR_02_03.pdf).
*  The "NGMCP": [The Nepal-German Manuscript **Cataloguing** Project](https://www.aai.uni-hamburg.de/en/forschung/ngmcp) (2002-2014).

For the cataloguing data, Hamburg University provided [this website](https://ngmcp.fdm.uni-hamburg.de/) that offered an [index](https://catalogue.ngmcp.uni-hamburg.de/content/search/ngmcpdocument.xed) (117,406 manuscripts) and a descriptive catalogue (nearly 16,000 manuscripts).  For the manuscripts it covers, the descriptive catalogue provides more detail than the index, including incipits and explicits.  This work was done by Diwakar Acharya, Kengo Harimoto, Andrey Klebanov and many other skilled scholars. The data was presented through a Wiki interface that permitted keyword searching.

In July 2025, Hamburg University deleted the Wiki.  After a hiatus of a few days, the University archived the data in a simplified form at [https://www-archiv.fdm.uni-hamburg.de/ngmcp/index.html](https://www-archiv.fdm.uni-hamburg.de/ngmcp/index.html). 

This Github repository is a copy of that data.    Tyler Neill has also provided a mirror of the same data (https://github.com/tylergneill/ngmcp-wiki-mirror).

## Related project
In a related program, the University of Heidelberg has a project entitled ["Documenta Nepalica: Documents on the History of Religion and Law of Pre-modern Nepal"](https://www.hadw-bw.de/en/research/research-center/documents-history-religion-and-law-pre-modern-nepal/) that focuses not on narrative and literary works, but on temple documents (edicts, land grants, contracts, deeds of donation, letters, etc.), legal documents (verdicts regarding moral conduct, letters granting absolution, caste regulations), and, to a much lesser extent, narrative or eulogical texts on local shrines.
